In mouse models of triple negative breast cancer  TNBC  Hh ligand produced by neoplastic cells reprogrammed cancer associated fibroblast  CAF  gene expression  driving tumor growth and metastasis. Hh activated CAFs upregulated expression of FGF  and production of fibrillar collagen  leading to FGFR and FAK activation in adjacent neoplastic cells  which then acquired stem like  drug resistant phenotype. Treatment with smoothened inhibitors  SMOi  reversed these phenotypes  Stromal treatment of TNBC patient derived xenograft  PDX  models with SMOi downregulated the expression of cancer stem cell markers and sensitized tumors to docetaxel  leading to markedly improved survival and reduced metastatic burden. In the phase clinical trial EDALINE  of  patients with metastatic TNBC derived clinical benefit from combination therapy with the SMOi Sonidegib and docetaxel chemotherapy  with one patient experiencing complete response. Markers of pathway activity correlated with response. These studies identify Hh signaling to CAFs as novel mediator of cancer stem cell plasticity and an exciting new therapeutic target in TNBC  SIGNIFICANCE  Compared to other breast cancer subtypes  TNBCs are associated with significantly worse patient outcomes. Standard of care systemic treatment for patients with nonBRCA  positive TNBC is cytotoxic chemotherapy. However  the failure of  of treated TNBCs to attain complete pathological response reflects the relative chemoresistance of these tumors. New therapeutic strategies are needed to improve  patient survival and quality of life. Here  we provide new insights into the dynamic interactions between heterotypic cells within tumor. Specifically  we establish the mechanisms by which CAFs define cancer cell phenotype and demonstrate that the bidirectional CAF cancer cell crosstalk can be successfully targeted in mice and humans using anti stromal therapy  INTRODUCTION Carcinogenesis draws many parallels with developmental biology. During development  dynamic interaction between stromal and epithelial cells drives patterning and function. Cell fate specification occurs through activation of transcriptional cascades in response to extracellular signals from developmental signaling pathways such as Hedgehog  Hh  Wnt  Notch  BMP  bone morphogenetic proteins  and FGF  fibroblast growth factor  . These pathways direct developmental processes either by direct cell to cell contact or through secreted diffusible factors  paracrine signaling . They can act individually or in concert with each other. For example  the interaction between Hh and FGF signaling pathways has been shown to mediate tracheal and lung branching morphogenesis  . In mature  differentiated tissues  these pathways are quiescent but may be reactivated to drive repair and regeneration to maintain tissue homeostasis  More specifically  the Hh developmental pathway is reactivated in subset of cancers. Binding of Hh ligand to its receptor Patched  PTCH  enables Smoothened  SMO  mediated translocation of Gli  into the cell nucleus to drive the transcription of Hh target genes  . Mutations in Hh pathway components are oncogenic drivers in  cGorlin  like  cancers such as medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma  BCC  where tumors rely on cell autonomous Hh signaling  . Small molecule inhibitors of SMO  Vismodegib and Sonidegib  are well tolerated and clinically approved for the treatment of these lesions  . In contrast  many other solid tumors  including breast cancer  predominantly exhibit ligand dependent pathway activation  . While Hh signaling is quiescent in the adult mammary gland  Hh ligand expression is reactivated in subset of breast cancers  particularly the poor prognosis TNBC subtype  . Breast cancer patients with paracrine Hh pathway signature  defined by  high epithelial SHH ligand expression in combination with high stromal GLI  expression  have greater risk of metastasis and breast cancer specific death  Neoplastic cells co opt components of the tumor microenvironment  TME  to further their progression. The TME is complex ecosystem comprising myriad of neoplastic and non malignant cells embedded in glycoprotein rich extracellular matrix  ECM . Prominent cell types include the endothelium  cells of the immune system and cancer associated fibroblast  CAFs . In addition to its role as physical scaffold to support tissue architecture  the ECM also functions as signal transducer between the different TME cell types  . The stiffness of the ECM and the abundance of fibrillar collagen immediately adjacent to epithelial lesions provide mechanical signals that facilitate tumor development and progression  . Not surprisingly  the TME has emerged as major determinant of cancer phenotype. In breast cancer  stromal metagenes  in particular those associated with ECM remodeling  strongly predict prognosis and response to chemotherapy  Whilst it is now apparent that Hh signals in paracrine manner in animal models of TNBC  and in isolated cancer stem cells  CSCs  detailed study of the dynamic crosstalk within the TME is required to make clinical progress in integrating anti stromal therapies into breast cancer treatment. Progress has been impeded by the field  limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying tumorstromal interactions  limited repertoire of well tolerated agents to target the TME  and an absence of predictive biomarkers for response to TME directed therapies  In this study  we investigated whether  and how  SMO inhibitors  SMOi  could be used for therapeutic reprograming of the TME in human TNBC  RESULTS Hh regulated epithelial stromal crosstalk mediates reversible breast cancer stem like phenotype To investigate the mechanistic basis for Hh dependent tumor growth and metastasis in TNBC  we used the murine  allograft model of low grade TNBC  in which transgenic Hh expression drives invasion  metastasis and high grade morphology  Hh  Supplementary Fig. A . Treatment with the SMO inhibitor  SMOi  GDC  Vismodegib  slowed tumor growth  reduced metastatic burden and improved overall animal survival of  Hh tumors  Supplementary Fig  B .  Ctrl and  Hh monoculture cell viability were similar between vehicle and SMOi treatment and the expression of canonical Hh target genes Ptch  Gli  and Hhip was downregulated in vivo but not in vitro  consistent with paracrine requirement for Hh signaling as previously reported  Supplementary Fig. E . The effects of SMO inhibition on tumor growth and gene expression were not observed in control tumors lacking Hh expression  Ctrl  or in benign adult mouse mammary gland  Supplementary Fig. B H  reflecting on target drug activities. Similar results were observed with the SMOi NVP LDE  Sonidegib  Supplementary Fig. I  To examine the transcriptional changes induced by Hh pathway activation in detail  we dissociated and analyzed freshly flow cytometry sorted stromal and epithelial fractions of  Ctrl and  Hh tumors  SMOi using RNA Sequencing  RNA Seq  Fig.  . Differential gene expression analysis confirmed effective cellular fractionation  with Hh transgene expression restricted to the epithelial cell population while Hh target genes Ptch  Gli  and Hhip expression were induced solely in the stromal fraction of  Hh tumors  Supplementary Table  In the epithelial compartment  genes were differentially expressed  fold change  with  upregulated and  downregulated genes in the neoplastic  Hh cells in comparison to  Ctrl or  Hh cells treated with SMOi  Transcriptional changes were robust and highly statistically significant  Fig.  . Hh expression in  cancer cells resulted in increased expression of stemness genes including Peg  fold  Igfbp  fold  and Thy  fold  which were downregulated following SMO inhibition  Fig.  Gene Set Enrichment Analysis  GSEA  and Gene Ontology  GO  analysis of the purified epithelial fraction highlighted enrichment for genes specifically and almost exclusively associated with mammary stemness and invasion  consistent with the morphologically undifferentiated phenotype previously observed in Hhoverexpressing tumors  Fig.  D and Supplementary Table  . To examine the cancer stem cell like  CSC  phenotype in greater detail  epithelial cells were profiled by flow cytometry.  Hh tumors had higher proportion of CD  hi cells  previously shown to be marker of mouse mammary CSCs  within the EpCAM CD  hiCD  cancer cell population  in  Hh tumors vs  in  Crtl tumors  Fig.  .  Hh tumors also had elevated expression of the stemness markers Id  Gpc  Thy  Sox  and Krt  validating the RNA Seq data  Fig.  F . Following transplantation of low numbers of sorted primary  Hh and  Ctrl cells into naive recipients  tumor latency was shorter and penetrance markedly higher in the  Hh group  Fig.  . Limiting dilution assays  were used to quantitate the impact of Hh signaling on tumor initiating capacity.  Ctrl and  Hh tumor cells were isolated by FACS and transplanted at various dilutions  Hh cells had significantly higher tumor initiating capacity  in  compared with  Ctrl cells  in  Fig.  . Importantly  the proliferation and expression  of CSC markers were indistinguishable between  Ctrl and  Hh cells in monoculture  indicating that Hh expression in  cells does not regulate CSC properties in cell autonomous manner  Supplementary Fig. E  Immunohistochemical detection of the mammary progenitor marker cytokeratin  CK  product of the Krt  gene  localized cells with stem progenitor signature specifically to the tumor stromal interface  Fig.  . SMO inhibition reduced the expression of Id  Gpc  Thy  Sox  and Krt  and significantly reduced the number of cells positive for CK  and the mitotic marker phospho Histone  at the tumor stromal interface  Fig.  I . These data demonstrate that paracrine Hh signaling results in the induction of reversible stemlike phenotype preferentially at the tumor stromal interface  Stromal Hh signaling leads to marked ECM related gene expression changes and associates with poor prognosis in patients with TNBC RNA Seq analysis of the stromal fraction revealed  genes that were differentially expressed  fold  with  upregulated and  downregulated genes in the stroma of  Hh tumors compared to  Ctrl and Hh tumor  SMOi  Supplementary Table  . number of genes were markedly upregulated by Hh signaling  in particular the growth factor gene Fgf  at more than  fold  St Sia  fold  and Tspan  fold  Fig.  . The large majority of gene expression changes in Hh activated stroma returned to baseline following treatment with SMOi  Fig.  and Supplementary Table  suggesting that the stromal transcriptional changes are SMO dependent and reversible  Comparative GO and GSEA analysis revealed ECM processes as highly enriched in the stromal fraction of  Hh tumors  Fig.  C  suggesting that  major influence of paracrine Hh activation on the tumor stroma is related to ECM production and remodeling  . Genes highly enriched in this set included collagens  Col  Col  Col  Col  Col  ECM remodeling metallopeptidases  Mmp  Mmp  Mmp  Adamts  Adamts  ECM glycoproteins  St sia  Rspo  Lama  Edil  Thbs  and cell adhesion molecules  Cldn  Cldn  Cldn  Cdh  Cdh  Fig.  . Interestingly  these ECM gene expression changes were not result of changes in stromal cellular composition due to Hh pathway activation and longterm SMO inhibition. Immunohistochemical analysis did not reveal any difference between  Ctrl and  Hh tumors in terms of CAFs  endothelial and innate immune cell abundance  regardless of treatment with SMOi  Supplementary Fig  A . This finding was confirmed using whole tumor qRT PCR and flow cytometry analysis  Supplementary Fig. B  To determine the prognostic value of the Hh activated stromal gene signature  HSGS  we examined its impact on overall survival using The Cancer Genome Atlas  TCGA  breast invasive carcinoma cohort. The HSGS was not predictive of patient outcome in the unstratified patient cohort  Fig.  but was associated with significantly lower patient overall survival uniquely in the basal breast cancer subtype  where Hh ligand is most frequently overexpressed  Hazard ratio  Fig.  Accumulating evidence suggests that CAFs contribute to tumor growth upon Hh ligand activation  . However  the stroma of  tumors is composed of multiple cell types  any of which may be responsible for Hh dependent gene expression changes. We used single cell RNA sequencing  scRNA Seq  approach to determine the cell population responding to paracrine Hh signaling. The microfluidic  Chromium system was used to comprehensively profile gene  expression at cellular resolution in thousands of cells isolated from freshly dissociated  Ctrl and  Hh tumors  SMOi. In total  we compared  FACS isolated cells from  Ctrl tumors  cells from  Hh tumors  and  single cells from  Hh tumor treated with SMOi  As shown in Figure  unsupervised clustering analysis of  cells revealed populations of myeloid  neoplastic  endothelial  CAF and natural killer cells within the breast TME  Fig.  . Importantly  the upregulation of canonical Hh target genes Gli  Ptch  Ptch  and Hhip and ECM genes such as Col  Tspan  St sia  and Fgf  was observed exclusively in the CAF population of  Hh compared to  Ctrl tumors  Fig.  and not in other stromal cell types. More specifically  the ECM signature detected in the stroma of Hh expressing tumors via  bulk  RNA Seq was driven by CAF gene expression  Fig.  C  Fig.  . This scRNA Seq approach also confirmed the lack of autocrine Hh pathway activation within the neoplastic cells  Fig.  . Treatment with SMOi almost completely reversed the Hh dependent gene expression changes observed in CAFs without affecting gene expression in other stromal cell types  Fig.  Supplementary Fig.  and Supplementary Table  highlighting the on target activity of SMOi at the single cell level  Co culture of primary CAFs with  Hh cells was sufficient to recapitulate this dynamic epithelial stromal crosstalk resulting in the induction of Hh target gene expression in the CAFs  Supplementary Fig. A  and concomitant upregulation of CSC markers Id  Gpc  Itgb  and Krt in  Hh cells compared to  Ctrl  CAF co culture systems  Supplementary Fig. A . Importantly  this stromalepithelial malignant crosstalk was blocked by SMOi  Fig.  Supplementary Fig  B . These data allow us to conclude that Hh signaling occurs solely in  paracrine manner in this murine model of TNBC and CAFs are the therapeutic target of SMOi in TNBC  Hh activated CAFs drive fibrillar collagen deposition and remodeling  resulting in mechanosignaling and stem like phenotype in adjacent neoplastic cells Bulk and scRNA Seq data suggested that stromal Hh signaling drives collagen remodeling in the local ECM  Fig.  C and Fig.  which is known to associate with breast cancer progression  . We employed second harmonic generation  SHG  microscopy  sensitive label free method for quantifying fibrillar collagen density and orientation in tissues  . SHG analysis revealed  fold increase in fibrillar collagen density at the tumor stromal interface of Hh expressing tumors  Fig  but not in the tumor center  data not shown . The increase in collagen abundance was confirmed by chromogenic staining using Picrosirius red  Fig.  . Further detailed analyses of the distribution and orientation of collagen fibers as described by Mayorca Guiliani et al.  and by Gray level co occurrence matrix  GLCM  analysis  revealed changes in texture and cross linking of the ECM with linearization of collagen fibers adjacent to epithelial lesions in  Hh tumors  hallmark of breast tumor growth and invasiveness  Fig.  . These features of the collagen ECM in Hh expressing tumors were ameliorated in mice treated with SMOi  Fig.  demonstrating an ongoing dependency on SMO activation  Sites of collagen deposition and cross linking at the stromal epithelial interface were also marked by increased phosphorylation and activation of focal adhesion kinase  FAK  on cancer cells  key signaling intermediate downstream of integrin receptors  Fig.  . These cells also expressed elevated cytokeratin  Fig  correlating fibrillar collagen content to FAK signaling and the acquisition of  stem like phenotype in the neoplastic cells. Importantly  mechanosignaling and cancer stemness exclusively occurred in close proximity to rich dense collagen regions and were not observed in the core of the  Hh tumors  Supplementary Fig. A  To directly assess the sufficiency of collagen mechanosignaling to promote stemness  the clonogenic potential of  Ctrl and  Hh cells was assessed using  dimensional cultures encapsulated within Alginate Collagen Inter Penetrating Network  IPN  hydrogels. The enrichment for fibrillar collagen in this in vitro model recapitulates the features of stromal collagen matrix deposition observed in Hhexpressing models. Increased content and presence of highly bundled fibrillar collagen significantly increased the clonogenic capacity of  cells  functional surrogate for CSC activity  independently of Hh ligand expression  Fig.  Furthermore  increasing collagen abundance also increased expression of the stem cell markers Id  Itgb  CD  and Krt  CK  Fig.  . These data demonstrate that Hh dependent stromal ECM remodeling is sufficient to foster CSC phenotype  Paracrine Hh FGF  signaling also contributes to CSC plasticity To identify additional mechanisms by which stromal signaling promotes the acquisition of CSC phenotype  we turned our attention to Fgf  which was strongly upregulated in Hh activated stroma compared to controls  Fig.  C and Supplementary Table  and  . qRT PCR analysis of whole tumors confirmed  fold upregulation of Fgf  mRNA in  Hh tumors  which was reversed upon SMOi treatment  Fig.  . Notably  subset of Hh activated CAFs exhibited robust expression of Fgf  at the single cell resolution  reflecting the spatial localization of these CAFs  in close proximity with  Hh cells  Fig.  . Immunohistochemical analysis of phospho FGFR revealed potent receptor activation in  Hh tumors  primarily in epithelial cells adjacent to stroma  which was reversed upon SMOi treatment  Fig.  . To explore the role of FGF  in the acquisition of the CSC phenotype  Ctrl cells were treated in vitro with recombinant FGF  protein and proliferation  stem cell marker expression and sphere forming capacity were evaluated. FGF  treatment led to modest increase in proliferation under serum and growth factor deprivation  Supplementary Fig. A . In contrast  the stemness markers Id  and Sox  were robustly upregulated  Fig.  and primary and secondary  sphere  forming  capacity  increased  by  fold  Fig  and  Supplementary Fig. B  suggesting specific effect of FGF  signaling on stemness  To test whether the induction of sphere forming capacity by FGF  treatment was epigenetically stable or plastic  we tested the impact of addition or removal of FGF  to primary and secondary sphere cultures. Increased sphere formation in response to FGF  was observed in secondary cultures regardless of whether those cells were pre treated with FGF  during primary cultures  Fig.  and Supplementary Fig. B . Furthermore  removal of recombinant FGF  decreased secondary sphere formation to levels comparable to those of cells never treated with FGF  ligand  Fig.  and Supplementary Fig. B . Consistent with this result  treatment of spheres with small molecule inhibitor of FGFR signaling  NVPBGJ  prevented FGF  mediated tumorsphere formation in primary or secondary cultures  Supplementary Fig. C . These results demonstrate that stromal derived FGF  is sufficient to promote reversible transition to CSC phenotype  rather than through the expansion of sub population of CSC  The CSC phenotype is associated with resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy in TNBC  . To test whether the FGF dependent increase in CSC alters the sensitivity  of TNBC cells to chemotherapy  the efficacy of docetaxel was evaluated in  cell lines in vitro. Monocultures of  Hh cells did not display differential sensitivity to docetaxel when compared to  Ctrl cells as expected  Supplementary Fig. D  However  stimulation of  Ctrl and  Hh models with recombinant FGF  ligand rescued these cells from docetaxel cytotoxicity  Fig.  . The FGFR inhibitor NVPBGJ  abrogated drug resistance conferred by FGF  Fig.  . Similar results were observed in the human MDA MB  cell line model of TNBC  Supplementary Fig. E . This result suggests that FGF  released by Hh activated CAFs  creates  cchemo resistant niche  at the tumor stromal interface that can serve as reservoir for eventual tumor relapse in TNBC. It also suggests that targeting both tumor and stromal compartments with chemotherapeutic regimen and SMOi  respectively  may be an effectively therapeutic strategy  Stromal SMO inhibition combined with chemotherapy markedly improves preclinical TNBC outcomes To directly test these findings in more clinically relevant models  we turned our analysis to xenograft models of human TNBC. All three patient derived xenograft  PDX  models tested were Hh ligand positive as was the MDA MB  cell line model  Supplementary Fig. A . We found convincing evidence of exclusively stromal restricted Hh signaling  using species specific RT PCR and sensitivity to SMOi  Supplementary Fig. B . In addition  in vitro treatment of MDA MB  cells with SMOi did not alter Hh target gene expression or proliferation  Supplementary Fig. D  consistent with paracrine requirement for Hh signaling in these models. The HCI  and MDA MB  models were chosen for further investigation  as they are well accepted models for TNBC  Analysis of the ECM in HCI  xenografts by SHG and picrosirius red staining revealed abundant fibrillar collagen exclusively at the tumor stromal interface  Fig.  B  that was highly linearized and densely packed as depicted by orientation and GLCM analysis  Fig.  . Areas of high fibrillar collagen density were also associated with concomitant FAK phosphorylation and expression of the human CSC marker ALDH  Fig.  . As observed in the transgenic model  collagen density and orientation  FAK phosphorylation and CSC marker expression were reduced following SMO inhibition  Fig  C  Based on these observations we predicted that SMOi would sensitize tumors to cytotoxic chemotherapy. HCI  PDX and MDA MB  xenografts were then treated with SMOi  docetaxel  Fig.  F . Compared with vehicle treatment  either SMOi or docetaxel monotherapy slowed tumor growth. However  the most robust and durable therapeutic effect occurred with combined therapy  Fig.  F . Interestingly  the proportion of mice with metastatic disease at ethical endpoint  based on primary tumor size  was doubled in the docetaxel treated group  an observation previously made with paclitaxel in TNBC mouse models  Fig.  . Combination therapy reduced the frequency of mice with metastatic disease to below that seen in the vehicle control group  despite these mice being alive much longer compared to those in the other treatment groups. Similar therapeutic benefit was observed in MDA MB  tumor bearing mice treated with combination therapy in terms of tumor growth  overall survival and histological changes  Supplementary Fig. A  We then examined the impact of stromal Hh pathway inhibition on the histology of the tumor epithelial and stromal compartments. The proportion and number of stromal cells in the HCI  PDX model were unaffected by long term SMOi and or chemotherapy treatments  data not shown . Even in the context of  docetaxel chemotherapy  Hh signaling was still stromally restricted  Supplementary Fig. E  arguing that SMOi does not sensitize cells to docetaxel via cellautonomous mechanism  Clinical evaluation of SMOi and docetaxel combination therapy in the phase clinical trial EDALINE  The promising preclinical study results led us to establish the EDALINE  GEICAM  phase trial of docetaxel in combination with SMOi  NVPLDE  Sonidegib  to determine the maximum tolerated dose  MTD  and the recommended phase II dose  RP  of this combined therapy in patients with metastatic TNBC. Twelve patients with prior standard of care chemotherapy treatments with taxanes and or anthracyclines were enrolled. Detailed information on clinical trial design  patient and treatment characteristics are described in Supplementary Tables  and  and on ClinicalTrials gov  Identifier  NCT  https  clinicaltrials gov ct  show NCT  term edaline rank  Combination therapy was well tolerated and the RP of Sonidegib  mg once daily in combination with Docetaxel  mg  every  days was established. Clinical response was evaluated according to standard clinical trial RECIST  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors  criteria version  . One patient experienced complete clinical response  defined as the disappearance of all target and non target tumor lesions and the absence of new tumor lesions. As shown in Figure  the  year old postmenopausal woman presented with metastatic disease in the lungs  red and blue arrows . Following  cycles of combined therapy  the patient achieved complete clinical response  evident by the complete resolution of all her lung  metastases on routine progress CT scan  Fig.  and Supplementary Tables  and  . Two other patients experienced disease stabilization  Supplementary Table  To assess if stromal Hh pathway activation determines clinical response  we evaluated epithelial SHH ligand and stromal GLI  expression in treatment na  afve surgical tissue by immunochemistry. Only  patient tumor samples were evaluable  Three out of  tumors had high paracrine Hh Pathway Activation Signature  HPAS  characterized by high epithelial SHH in combination with high stromal GLI  expression  Fig.  and Supplementary Table  . Of these  two patients experienced clinical response whereas all patients with low HPAS expression had progressive metastatic disease on the prescribed treatment regimen  Supplementary Table  . An additional patient experienced clinical benefit  but the status of Hh pathway activation was unknown as her tumor sample was not available for analysis  Supplementary Table  Downstream analysis of the effect of paracrine Hh signaling revealed moderate to high phospho FGFR expression  high collagen deposition and fiber linearization in treatment naive tumor specimens of the two responders with biopsy material available  Fig.  . This correlated with elevated phospho FAK mechanosignaling and ALDH  positive cells at the tumor stromal interface  Fig.  . In contrast  the non responder with high paracrine HPAS exhibited weak phospho FGFR expression  low collagen content and minimal no evidence of mechano signaling and breast cancer stem cells  Fig.  . We therefore conclude that these additional tumor factors may represent adjunct biomarkers of therapeutic response for patient selection for anti SMOi based combination therapies in Hh expressing TNBC  DISCUSSION In certain settings  CSCs are responsible for metastasis to distant organs  and are frequently enriched in residual tumors following chemotherapy  reflecting role in therapeutic resistance. The hierarchical model for CSC maintenance proposes that CSC behave like tissue resident physiological stem cells  self renewing and undergoing asymmetric divisions to generate differentiated progeny  However  evidence from cell culture models has challenged the  hierarchical CSC model  by suggesting that cancer cells can transition into CSC state under specific culture conditions  . In support of this notion  we now demonstrate that stromal cues from Hh activated CAFs  forming supportive niche enriched for FGF and fibrillar collagen rich ECM  are capable of inducing and maintain stem like phenotype in TNBC cells in vivo. By combining murine gainof function model  small molecule inhibitor studies in human xenografts with powerful in vitro systems  we have demonstrated the plastic characteristics of breast CSCs that can be successfully targeted using anti stromal therapies  reducing metastatic growth and sensitizing to taxane chemotherapy  Increased stromal collagen content correlates with stemness in the epidermis  both in the cancer and homeostatic contexts  . It also enhances CSC properties of breast cancer cells in vitro  . However  the impact of ECM collagen content and matrix mechanical properties on the biology of CSCs is not well defined. Our work provides new mechanistic insights  demonstrating that increased collagen density and fiber linearity at the tumor stroma interface are associated with FAK activation and increased CSC number  dependent upon Hh paracrine signaling  Notably  we report relationship between collagen abundance and clonogenicity in vitro and in vivo  Suppressing collagen production using SMO inhibitors was  associated with decreased Krt  and ALDH  CSCs  respectively  in both murine and human models of TNBC. Interestingly  recent data links mammographic fibrillar collagen density to breast cancer risk  raising the possibility that breast cancer progenitors in these patients may have expanded in response to dense collagen matrix  FGF signaling has been shown to drive malignant processes including stem cell self renewal  multipotency and therapeutic resistance  . In metastatic breast cancer  resistance to anti cancer treatment is primarily due to FGFR gene amplification  . Here  we demonstrate novel ligand driven mechanism by which FGFR activation mediates both breast cancer stemness and chemoresistance  downstream of activation of the Hh signaling pathway. Importantly  our findings strongly suggest that CAF targeting using small molecule inhibitors of SMO is sufficient to prevent FGF ligand signaling and may overcome resistance to chemotherapies. Interestingly  FGF  has been reported to be upregulated in prostate CAFs relative to normal fibroblasts  where it is also target of Hh Gli signaling  . Thus this axis may be operational  and of therapeutic value  in tumor types beyond TNBC  How FGFR activation and high FAK mechanosignaling lead to the establishment of stem like phenotype remains to be determined  but they are associated in vitro and in vivo with upregulation of transcription factors previously implicated in mammary physiological and cancer stem cells  including ID  and SOX  . The mechanisms underlying Id  and Sox  transcription are unknown. However Id  may be induced through Erk EGR  signaling  as observed in activated cells  downstream of both FAK and FGFR  . Our data also reveals the cooperative activity of ECM remodeling and FGF signaling in driving malignancy  and drug resistance  recapitulating the interaction seen between these pathways during development and wound healing  Importantly  many elements of Hh paracrine signaling to CAFs are active during embryonic development in mammals  though have not previously been linked  Dhh is highly expressed in subset of epithelial cells of the mammary end bud  an invasive and proliferative structure responsible for ductal elongation in the developing mouse mammary gland  . Consistent with our observation in TNBC  stromal but not epithelial Hh signaling is required for appropriate ductal morphogenesis  . number of FGF ligands are secreted by mammary stromal cells  and activation of epithelial FGFR  is required for mammary ductal elongation and stem cell activity  . In addition  mammary stromal fibroblasts secrete and remodel ECM components including collagens  . Similar to our results in neoplastic cells  increased collagen density and mechanosignaling via FAK is sufficient to inhibit mammary epithelial cell differentiation and increased clonogenic potential  . Thus the paracrine Hh signaling we observe in TNBC most likely represents the dysregulation and chronic activation of process that is important for normal mammary ductal morphogenesis  Using high throughput single cell RNA sequencing  we demonstrate that CAFs are the only stromal cell type responding to Hh ligand  and that SMO inhibitors act  on target  to reverse CAF gene expression changes induced by Hh signaling  Surprisingly  long term  up to  months  daily treatment with SMOi did not alter the stromal cell composition of mammary tumors. This result contrasts markedly to that recently observed in pancreatic  colon and bladder cancer models  where chronic SMO inhibition was associated with marked changes in stromal cellular composition and shorter survival for mice receiving long term SMOi treatment  . The basis  for this difference is not known  but may be explained by the divergent epi genomics contexts of these cancer types  resulting in the evolution of distinct tumor microenvironments  . Alternately  differences in the origin or phenotype of CAFs  in these endodermally derived tumors versus ectodermally derived mammary carcinomas may be relevant  The benefit from therapeutic targeting of CAFs is two fold. Firstly  others and we have provided evidence for the crucial role of CAFs in supporting CSC selfrenewal and resistance to chemotherapy  . Therefore  targeting the CAF population and the subsequent abolition of the CAF neoplastic cell interaction represent practical strategy to improve cancer outcomes. Secondly  unlike neoplastic cells  CAFs have not been reported to exhibit genomic instability and are therefore less likely to acquire resistance to therapy over time  making them good targets for combination cancer therapies. Combined therapy with SMOi  docetaxel was well tolerated by mice and humans  and effective in treating proportion of women with metastatic disease who had previously failed on taxane chemotherapy  including one patient who experienced complete response. These remarkable results provide the first evidence to our knowledge for clinical benefit from CAF directed therapy  Treatment response in patients correlated with high levels of paracrine Hh signaling  FGFR activation and fibrillar collagen deposition  suggesting that the mechanism of action in patients may be consistent with that in mouse models. Hh  FGFR or collagen pathway activation may have value as predictive biomarkers of response to SMOi  Whilst phase clinical trials are not designed nor powered to assess therapeutic efficacy  these data suggest an exciting new therapeutic strategy for drug resistant or metastatic TNBC which should proceed to prospective assessment through Phase II clinical trials  METHODS Cell culture  murine mammary carcinoma cells derived from the  SV  Tag mouse model  gift from.

In mouse models of triple negative breast cancer  TNBC  Hh ligand produced by neoplastic cells reprogrammed cancer associated fibroblast  CAF  gene expression  driving tumor growth and metastasis. Hh activated CAFs upregulated expression of FGF  and production of fibrillar collagen  leading to FGFR and FAK activation in adjacent neoplastic cells  which then acquired stem like  drug resistant phenotype. Treatment with smoothened inhibitors  SMOi  reversed these phenotypes  Stromal treatment of TNBC patient derived xenograft  PDX  models with SMOi downregulated the expression of cancer stem cell markers and sensitized tumors to docetaxel  leading to markedly improved survival and reduced metastatic burden. In the phase clinical trial EDALINE  of  patients with metastatic TNBC derived clinical benefit from combination therapy with the SMOi Sonidegib and docetaxel chemotherapy  with one patient experiencing complete response. Markers of pathway activity correlated with response. These studies identify Hh signaling to CAFs as novel mediator of cancer stem cell plasticity and an exciting new therapeutic target in TNBC  SIGNIFICANCE  Compared to other breast cancer subtypes  TNBCs are associated with significantly worse patient outcomes. Standard of care systemic treatment for patients with nonBRCA  positive TNBC is cytotoxic chemotherapy. However  the failure of  of treated TNBCs to attain complete pathological response reflects the relative chemoresistance of these tumors. New therapeutic strategies are needed to improve  patient survival and quality of life. Here  we provide new insights into the dynamic interactions between heterotypic cells within tumor. Specifically  we establish the mechanisms by which CAFs define cancer cell phenotype and demonstrate that the bidirectional CAF cancer cell crosstalk can be successfully targeted in mice and humans using anti stromal therapy  INTRODUCTION Carcinogenesis draws many parallels with developmental biology. During development  dynamic interaction between stromal and epithelial cells drives patterning and function. Cell fate specification occurs through activation of transcriptional cascades in response to extracellular signals from developmental signaling pathways such as Hedgehog  Hh  Wnt  Notch  BMP  bone morphogenetic proteins  and FGF  fibroblast growth factor  . These pathways direct developmental processes either by direct cell to cell contact or through secreted diffusible factors  paracrine signaling . They can act individually or in concert with each other. For example  the interaction between Hh and FGF signaling pathways has been shown to mediate tracheal and lung branching morphogenesis  . In mature  differentiated tissues  these pathways are quiescent but may be reactivated to drive repair and regeneration to maintain tissue homeostasis  More specifically  the Hh developmental pathway is reactivated in subset of cancers. Binding of Hh ligand to its receptor Patched  PTCH  enables Smoothened  SMO  mediated translocation of Gli  into the cell nucleus to drive the transcription of Hh target genes  . Mutations in Hh pathway components are oncogenic drivers in  cGorlin  like  cancers such as medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma  BCC  where tumors rely on cell autonomous Hh signaling  . Small molecule inhibitors of SMO  Vismodegib and Sonidegib  are well tolerated and clinically approved for the treatment of these lesions  . In contrast  many other solid tumors  including breast cancer  predominantly exhibit ligand dependent pathway activation  . While Hh signaling is quiescent in the adult mammary gland  Hh ligand expression is reactivated in subset of breast cancers  particularly the poor prognosis TNBC subtype  . Breast cancer patients with paracrine Hh pathway signature  defined by  high epithelial SHH ligand expression in combination with high stromal GLI  expression  have greater risk of metastasis and breast cancer specific death  Neoplastic cells co opt components of the tumor microenvironment  TME  to further their progression. The TME is complex ecosystem comprising myriad of neoplastic and non malignant cells embedded in glycoprotein rich extracellular matrix  ECM . Prominent cell types include the endothelium  cells of the immune system and cancer associated fibroblast  CAFs . In addition to its role as physical scaffold to support tissue architecture  the ECM also functions as signal transducer between the different TME cell types  . The stiffness of the ECM and the abundance of fibrillar collagen immediately adjacent to epithelial lesions provide mechanical signals that facilitate tumor development and progression  . Not surprisingly  the TME has emerged as major determinant of cancer phenotype. In breast cancer  stromal metagenes  in particular those associated with ECM remodeling  strongly predict prognosis and response to chemotherapy  Whilst it is now apparent that Hh signals in paracrine manner in animal models of TNBC  and in isolated cancer stem cells  CSCs  detailed study of the dynamic crosstalk within the TME is required to make clinical progress in integrating anti stromal therapies into breast cancer treatment. Progress has been impeded by the field  limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying tumorstromal interactions  limited repertoire of well tolerated agents to target the TME  and an absence of predictive biomarkers for response to TME directed therapies  In this study  we investigated whether  and how  SMO inhibitors  SMOi  could be used for therapeutic reprograming of the TME in human TNBC  RESULTS Hh regulated epithelial stromal crosstalk mediates reversible breast cancer stem like phenotype To investigate the mechanistic basis for Hh dependent tumor growth and metastasis in TNBC  we used the murine  allograft model of low grade TNBC  in which transgenic Hh expression drives invasion  metastasis and high grade morphology  Hh  Supplementary Fig. A . Treatment with the SMO inhibitor  SMOi  GDC  Vismodegib  slowed tumor growth  reduced metastatic burden and improved overall animal survival of  Hh tumors  Supplementary Fig  B .  Ctrl and  Hh monoculture cell viability were similar between vehicle and SMOi treatment and the expression of canonical Hh target genes Ptch  Gli  and Hhip was downregulated in vivo but not in vitro  consistent with paracrine requirement for Hh signaling as previously reported  Supplementary Fig. E . The effects of SMO inhibition on tumor growth and gene expression were not observed in control tumors lacking Hh expression  Ctrl  or in benign adult mouse mammary gland  Supplementary Fig. B H  reflecting on target drug activities. Similar results were observed with the SMOi NVP LDE  Sonidegib  Supplementary Fig. I  To examine the transcriptional changes induced by Hh pathway activation in detail  we dissociated and analyzed freshly flow cytometry sorted stromal and epithelial fractions of  Ctrl and  Hh tumors  SMOi using RNA Sequencing  RNA Seq  Fig.  . Differential gene expression analysis confirmed effective cellular fractionation  with Hh transgene expression restricted to the epithelial cell population while Hh target genes Ptch  Gli  and Hhip expression were induced solely in the stromal fraction of  Hh tumors  Supplementary Table  In the epithelial compartment  genes were differentially expressed  fold change  with  upregulated and  downregulated genes in the neoplastic  Hh cells in comparison to  Ctrl or  Hh cells treated with SMOi  Transcriptional changes were robust and highly statistically significant  Fig.  . Hh expression in  cancer cells resulted in increased expression of stemness genes including Peg  fold  Igfbp  fold  and Thy  fold  which were downregulated following SMO inhibition  Fig.  Gene Set Enrichment Analysis  GSEA  and Gene Ontology  GO  analysis of the purified epithelial fraction highlighted enrichment for genes specifically and almost exclusively associated with mammary stemness and invasion  consistent with the morphologically undifferentiated phenotype previously observed in Hhoverexpressing tumors  Fig.  D and Supplementary Table  . To examine the cancer stem cell like  CSC  phenotype in greater detail  epithelial cells were profiled by flow cytometry.  Hh tumors had higher proportion of CD  hi cells  previously shown to be marker of mouse mammary CSCs  within the EpCAM CD  hiCD  cancer cell population  in  Hh tumors vs  in  Crtl tumors  Fig.  .  Hh tumors also had elevated expression of the stemness markers Id  Gpc  Thy  Sox  and Krt  validating the RNA Seq data  Fig.  F . Following transplantation of low numbers of sorted primary  Hh and  Ctrl cells into naive recipients  tumor latency was shorter and penetrance markedly higher in the  Hh group  Fig.  . Limiting dilution assays  were used to quantitate the impact of Hh signaling on tumor initiating capacity.  Ctrl and  Hh tumor cells were isolated by FACS and transplanted at various dilutions  Hh cells had significantly higher tumor initiating capacity  in  compared with  Ctrl cells  in  Fig.  . Importantly  the proliferation and expression  of CSC markers were indistinguishable between  Ctrl and  Hh cells in monoculture  indicating that Hh expression in  cells does not regulate CSC properties in cell autonomous manner  Supplementary Fig. E  Immunohistochemical detection of the mammary progenitor marker cytokeratin  CK  product of the Krt  gene  localized cells with stem progenitor signature specifically to the tumor stromal interface  Fig.  . SMO inhibition reduced the expression of Id  Gpc  Thy  Sox  and Krt  and significantly reduced the number of cells positive for CK  and the mitotic marker phospho Histone  at the tumor stromal interface  Fig.  I . These data demonstrate that paracrine Hh signaling results in the induction of reversible stemlike phenotype preferentially at the tumor stromal interface  Stromal Hh signaling leads to marked ECM related gene expression changes and associates with poor prognosis in patients with TNBC RNA Seq analysis of the stromal fraction revealed  genes that were differentially expressed  fold  with  upregulated and  downregulated genes in the stroma of  Hh tumors compared to  Ctrl and Hh tumor  SMOi  Supplementary Table  . number of genes were markedly upregulated by Hh signaling  in particular the growth factor gene Fgf  at more than  fold  St Sia  fold  and Tspan  fold  Fig.  . The large majority of gene expression changes in Hh activated stroma returned to baseline following treatment with SMOi  Fig.  and Supplementary Table  suggesting that the stromal transcriptional changes are SMO dependent and reversible  Comparative GO and GSEA analysis revealed ECM processes as highly enriched in the stromal fraction of  Hh tumors  Fig.  C  suggesting that  major influence of paracrine Hh activation on the tumor stroma is related to ECM production and remodeling  . Genes highly enriched in this set included collagens  Col  Col  Col  Col  Col  ECM remodeling metallopeptidases  Mmp  Mmp  Mmp  Adamts  Adamts  ECM glycoproteins  St sia  Rspo  Lama  Edil  Thbs  and cell adhesion molecules  Cldn  Cldn  Cldn  Cdh  Cdh  Fig.  . Interestingly  these ECM gene expression changes were not result of changes in stromal cellular composition due to Hh pathway activation and longterm SMO inhibition. Immunohistochemical analysis did not reveal any difference between  Ctrl and  Hh tumors in terms of CAFs  endothelial and innate immune cell abundance  regardless of treatment with SMOi  Supplementary Fig  A . This finding was confirmed using whole tumor qRT PCR and flow cytometry analysis  Supplementary Fig. B  To determine the prognostic value of the Hh activated stromal gene signature  HSGS  we examined its impact on overall survival using The Cancer Genome Atlas  TCGA  breast invasive carcinoma cohort. The HSGS was not predictive of patient outcome in the unstratified patient cohort  Fig.  but was associated with significantly lower patient overall survival uniquely in the basal breast cancer subtype  where Hh ligand is most frequently overexpressed  Hazard ratio  Fig.  Accumulating evidence suggests that CAFs contribute to tumor growth upon Hh ligand activation  . However  the stroma of  tumors is composed of multiple cell types  any of which may be responsible for Hh dependent gene expression changes. We used single cell RNA sequencing  scRNA Seq  approach to determine the cell population responding to paracrine Hh signaling. The microfluidic  Chromium system was used to comprehensively profile gene  expression at cellular resolution in thousands of cells isolated from freshly dissociated  Ctrl and  Hh tumors  SMOi. In total  we compared  FACS isolated cells from  Ctrl tumors  cells from  Hh tumors  and  single cells from  Hh tumor treated with SMOi  As shown in Figure  unsupervised clustering analysis of  cells revealed populations of myeloid  neoplastic  endothelial  CAF and natural killer cells within the breast TME  Fig.  . Importantly  the upregulation of canonical Hh target genes Gli  Ptch  Ptch  and Hhip and ECM genes such as Col  Tspan  St sia  and Fgf  was observed exclusively in the CAF population of  Hh compared to  Ctrl tumors  Fig.  and not in other stromal cell types. More specifically  the ECM signature detected in the stroma of Hh expressing tumors via  bulk  RNA Seq was driven by CAF gene expression  Fig.  C  Fig.  . This scRNA Seq approach also confirmed the lack of autocrine Hh pathway activation within the neoplastic cells  Fig.  . Treatment with SMOi almost completely reversed the Hh dependent gene expression changes observed in CAFs without affecting gene expression in other stromal cell types  Fig.  Supplementary Fig.  and Supplementary Table  highlighting the on target activity of SMOi at the single cell level  Co culture of primary CAFs with  Hh cells was sufficient to recapitulate this dynamic epithelial stromal crosstalk resulting in the induction of Hh target gene expression in the CAFs  Supplementary Fig. A  and concomitant upregulation of CSC markers Id  Gpc  Itgb  and Krt in  Hh cells compared to  Ctrl  CAF co culture systems  Supplementary Fig. A . Importantly  this stromalepithelial malignant crosstalk was blocked by SMOi  Fig.  Supplementary Fig  B . These data allow us to conclude that Hh signaling occurs solely in  paracrine manner in this murine model of TNBC and CAFs are the therapeutic target of SMOi in TNBC  Hh activated CAFs drive fibrillar collagen deposition and remodeling  resulting in mechanosignaling and stem like phenotype in adjacent neoplastic cells Bulk and scRNA Seq data suggested that stromal Hh signaling drives collagen remodeling in the local ECM  Fig.  C and Fig.  which is known to associate with breast cancer progression  . We employed second harmonic generation  SHG  microscopy  sensitive label free method for quantifying fibrillar collagen density and orientation in tissues  . SHG analysis revealed  fold increase in fibrillar collagen density at the tumor stromal interface of Hh expressing tumors  Fig  but not in the tumor center  data not shown . The increase in collagen abundance was confirmed by chromogenic staining using Picrosirius red  Fig.  . Further detailed analyses of the distribution and orientation of collagen fibers as described by Mayorca Guiliani et al.  and by Gray level co occurrence matrix  GLCM  analysis  revealed changes in texture and cross linking of the ECM with linearization of collagen fibers adjacent to epithelial lesions in  Hh tumors  hallmark of breast tumor growth and invasiveness  Fig.  . These features of the collagen ECM in Hh expressing tumors were ameliorated in mice treated with SMOi  Fig.  demonstrating an ongoing dependency on SMO activation  Sites of collagen deposition and cross linking at the stromal epithelial interface were also marked by increased phosphorylation and activation of focal adhesion kinase  FAK  on cancer cells  key signaling intermediate downstream of integrin receptors  Fig.  . These cells also expressed elevated cytokeratin  Fig  correlating fibrillar collagen content to FAK signaling and the acquisition of  stem like phenotype in the neoplastic cells. Importantly  mechanosignaling and cancer stemness exclusively occurred in close proximity to rich dense collagen regions and were not observed in the core of the  Hh tumors  Supplementary Fig. A  To directly assess the sufficiency of collagen mechanosignaling to promote stemness  the clonogenic potential of  Ctrl and  Hh cells was assessed using  dimensional cultures encapsulated within Alginate Collagen Inter Penetrating Network  IPN  hydrogels. The enrichment for fibrillar collagen in this in vitro model recapitulates the features of stromal collagen matrix deposition observed in Hhexpressing models. Increased content and presence of highly bundled fibrillar collagen significantly increased the clonogenic capacity of  cells  functional surrogate for CSC activity  independently of Hh ligand expression  Fig.  Furthermore  increasing collagen abundance also increased expression of the stem cell markers Id  Itgb  CD  and Krt  CK  Fig.  . These data demonstrate that Hh dependent stromal ECM remodeling is sufficient to foster CSC phenotype  Paracrine Hh FGF  signaling also contributes to CSC plasticity To identify additional mechanisms by which stromal signaling promotes the acquisition of CSC phenotype  we turned our attention to Fgf  which was strongly upregulated in Hh activated stroma compared to controls  Fig.  C and Supplementary Table  and  . qRT PCR analysis of whole tumors confirmed  fold upregulation of Fgf  mRNA in  Hh tumors  which was reversed upon SMOi treatment  Fig.  . Notably  subset of Hh activated CAFs exhibited robust expression of Fgf  at the single cell resolution  reflecting the spatial localization of these CAFs  in close proximity with  Hh cells  Fig.  . Immunohistochemical analysis of phospho FGFR revealed potent receptor activation in  Hh tumors  primarily in epithelial cells adjacent to stroma  which was reversed upon SMOi treatment  Fig.  . To explore the role of FGF  in the acquisition of the CSC phenotype  Ctrl cells were treated in vitro with recombinant FGF  protein and proliferation  stem cell marker expression and sphere forming capacity were evaluated. FGF  treatment led to modest increase in proliferation under serum and growth factor deprivation  Supplementary Fig. A . In contrast  the stemness markers Id  and Sox  were robustly upregulated  Fig.  and primary and secondary  sphere  forming  capacity  increased  by  fold  Fig  and  Supplementary Fig. B  suggesting specific effect of FGF  signaling on stemness  To test whether the induction of sphere forming capacity by FGF  treatment was epigenetically stable or plastic  we tested the impact of addition or removal of FGF  to primary and secondary sphere cultures. Increased sphere formation in response to FGF  was observed in secondary cultures regardless of whether those cells were pre treated with FGF  during primary cultures  Fig.  and Supplementary Fig. B . Furthermore  removal of recombinant FGF  decreased secondary sphere formation to levels comparable to those of cells never treated with FGF  ligand  Fig.  and Supplementary Fig. B . Consistent with this result  treatment of spheres with small molecule inhibitor of FGFR signaling  NVPBGJ  prevented FGF  mediated tumorsphere formation in primary or secondary cultures  Supplementary Fig. C . These results demonstrate that stromal derived FGF  is sufficient to promote reversible transition to CSC phenotype  rather than through the expansion of sub population of CSC  The CSC phenotype is associated with resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy in TNBC  . To test whether the FGF dependent increase in CSC alters the sensitivity  of TNBC cells to chemotherapy  the efficacy of docetaxel was evaluated in  cell lines in vitro. Monocultures of  Hh cells did not display differential sensitivity to docetaxel when compared to  Ctrl cells as expected  Supplementary Fig. D  However  stimulation of  Ctrl and  Hh models with recombinant FGF  ligand rescued these cells from docetaxel cytotoxicity  Fig.  . The FGFR inhibitor NVPBGJ  abrogated drug resistance conferred by FGF  Fig.  . Similar results were observed in the human MDA MB  cell line model of TNBC  Supplementary Fig. E . This result suggests that FGF  released by Hh activated CAFs  creates  cchemo resistant niche  at the tumor stromal interface that can serve as reservoir for eventual tumor relapse in TNBC. It also suggests that targeting both tumor and stromal compartments with chemotherapeutic regimen and SMOi  respectively  may be an effectively therapeutic strategy  Stromal SMO inhibition combined with chemotherapy markedly improves preclinical TNBC outcomes To directly test these findings in more clinically relevant models  we turned our analysis to xenograft models of human TNBC. All three patient derived xenograft  PDX  models tested were Hh ligand positive as was the MDA MB  cell line model  Supplementary Fig. A . We found convincing evidence of exclusively stromal restricted Hh signaling  using species specific RT PCR and sensitivity to SMOi  Supplementary Fig. B . In addition  in vitro treatment of MDA MB  cells with SMOi did not alter Hh target gene expression or proliferation  Supplementary Fig. D  consistent with paracrine requirement for Hh signaling in these models. The HCI  and MDA MB  models were chosen for further investigation  as they are well accepted models for TNBC  Analysis of the ECM in HCI  xenografts by SHG and picrosirius red staining revealed abundant fibrillar collagen exclusively at the tumor stromal interface  Fig.  B  that was highly linearized and densely packed as depicted by orientation and GLCM analysis  Fig.  . Areas of high fibrillar collagen density were also associated with concomitant FAK phosphorylation and expression of the human CSC marker ALDH  Fig.  . As observed in the transgenic model  collagen density and orientation  FAK phosphorylation and CSC marker expression were reduced following SMO inhibition  Fig  C  Based on these observations we predicted that SMOi would sensitize tumors to cytotoxic chemotherapy. HCI  PDX and MDA MB  xenografts were then treated with SMOi  docetaxel  Fig.  F . Compared with vehicle treatment  either SMOi or docetaxel monotherapy slowed tumor growth. However  the most robust and durable therapeutic effect occurred with combined therapy  Fig.  F . Interestingly  the proportion of mice with metastatic disease at ethical endpoint  based on primary tumor size  was doubled in the docetaxel treated group  an observation previously made with paclitaxel in TNBC mouse models  Fig.  . Combination therapy reduced the frequency of mice with metastatic disease to below that seen in the vehicle control group  despite these mice being alive much longer compared to those in the other treatment groups. Similar therapeutic benefit was observed in MDA MB  tumor bearing mice treated with combination therapy in terms of tumor growth  overall survival and histological changes  Supplementary Fig. A  We then examined the impact of stromal Hh pathway inhibition on the histology of the tumor epithelial and stromal compartments. The proportion and number of stromal cells in the HCI  PDX model were unaffected by long term SMOi and or chemotherapy treatments  data not shown . Even in the context of  docetaxel chemotherapy  Hh signaling was still stromally restricted  Supplementary Fig. E  arguing that SMOi does not sensitize cells to docetaxel via cellautonomous mechanism  Clinical evaluation of SMOi and docetaxel combination therapy in the phase clinical trial EDALINE  The promising preclinical study results led us to establish the EDALINE  GEICAM  phase trial of docetaxel in combination with SMOi  NVPLDE  Sonidegib  to determine the maximum tolerated dose  MTD  and the recommended phase II dose  RP  of this combined therapy in patients with metastatic TNBC. Twelve patients with prior standard of care chemotherapy treatments with taxanes and or anthracyclines were enrolled. Detailed information on clinical trial design  patient and treatment characteristics are described in Supplementary Tables  and  and on ClinicalTrials gov  Identifier  NCT  https  clinicaltrials gov ct  show NCT  term edaline rank  Combination therapy was well tolerated and the RP of Sonidegib  mg once daily in combination with Docetaxel  mg  every  days was established. Clinical response was evaluated according to standard clinical trial RECIST  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors  criteria version  . One patient experienced complete clinical response  defined as the disappearance of all target and non target tumor lesions and the absence of new tumor lesions. As shown in Figure  the  year old postmenopausal woman presented with metastatic disease in the lungs  red and blue arrows . Following  cycles of combined therapy  the patient achieved complete clinical response  evident by the complete resolution of all her lung  metastases on routine progress CT scan  Fig.  and Supplementary Tables  and  . Two other patients experienced disease stabilization  Supplementary Table  To assess if stromal Hh pathway activation determines clinical response  we evaluated epithelial SHH ligand and stromal GLI  expression in treatment na  afve surgical tissue by immunochemistry. Only  patient tumor samples were evaluable  Three out of  tumors had high paracrine Hh Pathway Activation Signature  HPAS  characterized by high epithelial SHH in combination with high stromal GLI  expression  Fig.  and Supplementary Table  . Of these  two patients experienced clinical response whereas all patients with low HPAS expression had progressive metastatic disease on the prescribed treatment regimen  Supplementary Table  . An additional patient experienced clinical benefit  but the status of Hh pathway activation was unknown as her tumor sample was not available for analysis  Supplementary Table  Downstream analysis of the effect of paracrine Hh signaling revealed moderate to high phospho FGFR expression  high collagen deposition and fiber linearization in treatment naive tumor specimens of the two responders with biopsy material available  Fig.  . This correlated with elevated phospho FAK mechanosignaling and ALDH  positive cells at the tumor stromal interface  Fig.  . In contrast  the non responder with high paracrine HPAS exhibited weak phospho FGFR expression  low collagen content and minimal no evidence of mechano signaling and breast cancer stem cells  Fig.  . We therefore conclude that these additional tumor factors may represent adjunct biomarkers of therapeutic response for patient selection for anti SMOi based combination therapies in Hh expressing TNBC  DISCUSSION In certain settings  CSCs are responsible for metastasis to distant organs  and are frequently enriched in residual tumors following chemotherapy  reflecting role in therapeutic resistance. The hierarchical model for CSC maintenance proposes that CSC behave like tissue resident physiological stem cells  self renewing and undergoing asymmetric divisions to generate differentiated progeny  However  evidence from cell culture models has challenged the  hierarchical CSC model  by suggesting that cancer cells can transition into CSC state under specific culture conditions  . In support of this notion  we now demonstrate that stromal cues from Hh activated CAFs  forming supportive niche enriched for FGF and fibrillar collagen rich ECM  are capable of inducing and maintain stem like phenotype in TNBC cells in vivo. By combining murine gainof function model  small molecule inhibitor studies in human xenografts with powerful in vitro systems  we have demonstrated the plastic characteristics of breast CSCs that can be successfully targeted using anti stromal therapies  reducing metastatic growth and sensitizing to taxane chemotherapy  Increased stromal collagen content correlates with stemness in the epidermis  both in the cancer and homeostatic contexts  . It also enhances CSC properties of breast cancer cells in vitro  . However  the impact of ECM collagen content and matrix mechanical properties on the biology of CSCs is not well defined. Our work provides new mechanistic insights  demonstrating that increased collagen density and fiber linearity at the tumor stroma interface are associated with FAK activation and increased CSC number  dependent upon Hh paracrine signaling  Notably  we report relationship between collagen abundance and clonogenicity in vitro and in vivo  Suppressing collagen production using SMO inhibitors was  associated with decreased Krt  and ALDH  CSCs  respectively  in both murine and human models of TNBC. Interestingly  recent data links mammographic fibrillar collagen density to breast cancer risk  raising the possibility that breast cancer progenitors in these patients may have expanded in response to dense collagen matrix  FGF signaling has been shown to drive malignant processes including stem cell self renewal  multipotency and therapeutic resistance  . In metastatic breast cancer  resistance to anti cancer treatment is primarily due to FGFR gene amplification  . Here  we demonstrate novel ligand driven mechanism by which FGFR activation mediates both breast cancer stemness and chemoresistance  downstream of activation of the Hh signaling pathway. Importantly  our findings strongly suggest that CAF targeting using small molecule inhibitors of SMO is sufficient to prevent FGF ligand signaling and may overcome resistance to chemotherapies. Interestingly  FGF  has been reported to be upregulated in prostate CAFs relative to normal fibroblasts  where it is also target of Hh Gli signaling  . Thus this axis may be operational  and of therapeutic value  in tumor types beyond TNBC  How FGFR activation and high FAK mechanosignaling lead to the establishment of stem like phenotype remains to be determined  but they are associated in vitro and in vivo with upregulation of transcription factors previously implicated in mammary physiological and cancer stem cells  including ID  and SOX  . The mechanisms underlying Id  and Sox  transcription are unknown. However Id  may be induced through Erk EGR  signaling  as observed in activated cells  downstream of both FAK and FGFR  . Our data also reveals the cooperative activity of ECM remodeling and FGF signaling in driving malignancy  and drug resistance  recapitulating the interaction seen between these pathways during development and wound healing  Importantly  many elements of Hh paracrine signaling to CAFs are active during embryonic development in mammals  though have not previously been linked  Dhh is highly expressed in subset of epithelial cells of the mammary end bud  an invasive and proliferative structure responsible for ductal elongation in the developing mouse mammary gland  . Consistent with our observation in TNBC  stromal but not epithelial Hh signaling is required for appropriate ductal morphogenesis  . number of FGF ligands are secreted by mammary stromal cells  and activation of epithelial FGFR  is required for mammary ductal elongation and stem cell activity  . In addition  mammary stromal fibroblasts secrete and remodel ECM components including collagens  . Similar to our results in neoplastic cells  increased collagen density and mechanosignaling via FAK is sufficient to inhibit mammary epithelial cell differentiation and increased clonogenic potential  . Thus the paracrine Hh signaling we observe in TNBC most likely represents the dysregulation and chronic activation of process that is important for normal mammary ductal morphogenesis  Using high throughput single cell RNA sequencing  we demonstrate that CAFs are the only stromal cell type responding to Hh ligand  and that SMO inhibitors act  on target  to reverse CAF gene expression changes induced by Hh signaling  Surprisingly  long term  up to  months  daily treatment with SMOi did not alter the stromal cell composition of mammary tumors. This result contrasts markedly to that recently observed in pancreatic  colon and bladder cancer models  where chronic SMO inhibition was associated with marked changes in stromal cellular composition and shorter survival for mice receiving long term SMOi treatment  . The basis  for this difference is not known  but may be explained by the divergent epi genomics contexts of these cancer types  resulting in the evolution of distinct tumor microenvironments  . Alternately  differences in the origin or phenotype of CAFs  in these endodermally derived tumors versus ectodermally derived mammary carcinomas may be relevant  The benefit from therapeutic targeting of CAFs is two fold. Firstly  others and we have provided evidence for the crucial role of CAFs in supporting CSC selfrenewal and resistance to chemotherapy  . Therefore  targeting the CAF population and the subsequent abolition of the CAF neoplastic cell interaction represent practical strategy to improve cancer outcomes. Secondly  unlike neoplastic cells  CAFs have not been reported to exhibit genomic instability and are therefore less likely to acquire resistance to therapy over time  making them good targets for combination cancer therapies. Combined therapy with SMOi  docetaxel was well tolerated by mice and humans  and effective in treating proportion of women with metastatic disease who had previously failed on taxane chemotherapy  including one patient who experienced complete response. These remarkable results provide the first evidence to our knowledge for clinical benefit from CAF directed therapy  Treatment response in patients correlated with high levels of paracrine Hh signaling  FGFR activation and fibrillar collagen deposition  suggesting that the mechanism of action in patients may be consistent with that in mouse models. Hh  FGFR or collagen pathway activation may have value as predictive biomarkers of response to SMOi  Whilst phase clinical trials are not designed nor powered to assess therapeutic efficacy  these data suggest an exciting new therapeutic strategy for drug resistant or metastatic TNBC which should proceed to prospective assessment through Phase II clinical trials  METHODS Cell culture  murine mammary carcinoma cells derived from the  SV  Tag mouse model  gift from.

Sphere media was composed of DMEM  methylcellulose  B  supplement  Invitrogen  and  g mL sodium heparin  KU  Sigma Aldrich  Tumorspheres were treated with  ng mL recombinant FGF  D Systems  and  or  nM FGFR inhibitor  NVP BGJ  Selleckchem  Sphere formation efficiency was calculated using the following formula  Number of tumorspheres larger than  m  Number of single cells seeded  Patients Patients in this study were enrolled in the GEICAM  EDALINE  clinical trial  ClinicalTrials gov Identifier  NCT  single arm  open label  phase  dose escalation study in which patients with TNBC were treated with the SMOi Sonidegib  LDE  in combination with docetaxel to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose and the Recommended Phase II Dose  RP  as the primary objective. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and documented before performing any protocol specific procedure. The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines  ICH GCP  the Declaration of Helsinki and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws. The protocol was approved by the Institutional  Review Board and the Ethics Committee of all the participating sites  Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara  n  Hospital Universitario Cl  adnico San Carlos  Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Coru  a  Hospital Universitario Virgen del Roc  ado  Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Victoria  according to the requirements of the  Spanish  regulations  GEICAM  clinicaltrials gov identifier  NCT  . Eligible patients  with no more than three previous lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease were treated with  day cycles of intravenous docetaxel  mg  on day  and oral Sonidegib administered at increasing doses of  and  mg once daily  QD  until radiographic or symptomatic progression  unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of the informed consent  whichever occurred first. All patients at each dose level completed at least  treatment cycles before being enrolled to the next Sonidegib dose level. Twelve patients were enrolled into the study and were treated as described above  Clinical markers of therapeutic activity The expression of Sonic Hedgehog ligand  SHH  and GLI  were examined by immunohistochemistry  IHC  from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded  FFPE  pre treatment primary breast tumors from patients enrolled in the EDALINE clinical trial. Pathologists  who were blinded to clinical parameters  carried out biomarker analysis. Two specialist breast pathologists independently calculated the Histo score  Hscore  based on the percentage of stained cells  SHH and GLI  expression  and staining intensity on predetermined scale  no staining to  strong  in the tumor epithelial cells  SHH  and the tumor stroma  GLI  . Predefined cut offs for high low biomarker expression were established based on standard criteria  median Hscore for SHH in tumor cells and intensity staining for GLI  in the  stroma  We defined Hedgehog Pathway Activation Signature  HPAS  predictive for clinical response to sonidegib  LDE  in combination with docetaxel as cases with both high SHH expression in the tumor epithelium  SHH Hscore  and intense GLI  expression in the tumor stroma  Statistical analysis All statistical analyses of all data were performed using GraphPad Prism  software  GraphPad Software . For all in vitro experiments  three or six technical replicates were analyzed for each experiment  and results are presented as the mean  e. of three biological replicates. Quantitative analyses were carried out using unpaired two tailed Student  t test with equal standard deviation after confirming that the data met appropriate assumptions  normality  homogenous variance  and independent sampling .  mice per treatment group were used for all in vivo experiments with SMOi treatment.  mice per treatment group were utilized for the RNA Seq. For all RT qPCR experiments  three technical replicates were analyzed for each experiment  and results are presented as the mean  e. of three biological replicates. Subsequent statistical analysis from in vivo experiments was performed with either unpaired two sided student tests or the Fisher  exact test. Survival analysis was performed using the Log rank  Mantel Cox  test. P value  was considered statistically significant. *P  **P  ***P  ****P  . Estimation of variation within each group was determined by e. Sample size estimation was initially chosen by using power calculations for guidance  http  biomath info power ttest htm . Effect sizes were estimated at  for single agent arms  based on earlier data with single agent docetaxel and SMO inhibitors  With alpha  and power  and allowing for attrition of  mouse group  mice per group were needed for all preclinical studies.

The Chi Square Test of Independence was assessed to examine the association between epithelial SHH and stromal GLI  expression and efficacy endpoints  best tumor response  complete or partial response  stable disease  progression disease and Time to Progression  TTP  . TTP was defined as the time from treatment commencement until objective tumor progression  does not include deaths . Progression Free Survival  PFS  was explored using Kaplan Meier survival analysis. PFS was defined as the time from treatment commencement until disease progression or death. For mouse and clinical studies  specialists were blinded to the experiment treatment groups  AUTHORS CONTRIBUTION Conception and design  Aur  lie. Cazet  Mun.
